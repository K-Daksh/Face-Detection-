# Face Detection using C++
This is my first try for making a **Face detection and recognisation** project using **C++** as main coding 
language and **Haar Cascads** algorithm (most widely used OpenCV's object detection algorithm).

## Getting Started

* You can either copy the content of this file to any file in the folder that's already added to the path 
* You can create a new project and use this file. Remember to add that folder to the path.
* Use the provided .xml file and change the path value in FaceDetection.cpp to where you placed this file.

### Prerequisites

Softwares and tools you'll need to run this project sucessfully on your machine.

```
Microsoft Visual Studio (Newer version) and the .xml file provided above.
```

### Executing the project

You can execute this project by pressing Ctrl+f5.
Closing the terminal will terminate the execution process.

### Knowledge required

* Basic OpenCV knowledge
* Intermediate C++ knowledge
* Basic Haar Cascade Algorithm's knowledge

## Updates Planned

ðŸš€ This project will be regularly updated till we reach our goal of making a fluid **Face Detection and Recognisation** system using C++.

## Resources you can follow to excell at OpenCV

My personal favourite :
